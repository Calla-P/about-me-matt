                <div class="h-50"></div>
                <p>I was born on the 3rd of August in the year of our Lord 1989 in the township of Edison, New Jersey at John F. Kennedy Medical Center room 204 at exactly 11:12 p.m. I remember it was raining. The storm was a portent that I should end up in a city where it always rains. That wouldn't happen for another 26 years. Three years after that fateful day I left the Garden State, having done all there is to do. I moved to Lawrence, Kansas to attend the University of Kansas. That wouldn't happen for another 14 years.

                <p>By this time next year like to have a job as a software developer. I want it to be a remote position or one that offers flexibility, so that I can drive my two dogs back home to Kansas over the holidays. That way I don't have to pay someone to be in my apartment on Christmas Day.</p>
